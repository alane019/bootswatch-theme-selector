Bootswatch Theme Selector is a front end React application that uses the [Bootswatch API](https://bootswatch.com/help/#api) to retrieve a current list of Bootswatch themes and allows the user to see the styling of any of these themes applied on a single page. The data returned from the API is used to populate the select dropdown menu, theme description, and updates the page's CSS link tag to apply the selected theme. The Bootswatch CDN link tag is displayed on the screen for the selected theme. 

 [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) is collection of open source themes for [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). Bootswatch Theme Selector allows you to preview each theme on a single page and includes the link tag for the selected theme.
